# wishlist-app

*Better name hopefully to come. The real point of this project is just to regularly work on and finish a project, similar to [color me 2](https://github.com/susanpallmann/color-me-2). Because this is one of my more fleshed-out project ideas, it felt worth doing even if it's never really used. I might at least learn something along the way to keep in mind for future projects that are actually worth launching.*
